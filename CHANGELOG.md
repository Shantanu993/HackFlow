### **Guidelines for making changes**

1. **[Unreleased] section**
   - Keep an `[Unreleased]` section at the top for ongoing work.
   - Do **not** add a date here until the changes are released.

2. **Versioning**
   - Use **semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)**:
     - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes or major updates
     - **MINOR**: New features, backward-compatible
     - **PATCH**: Bug fixes, minor improvements

3. **Date**
   - Include the **release date** in `YYYY-MM-DD` format for each version.
   - `[Unreleased]` remains undated.

4. **Categories**
   - **Added**: New features, endpoints, or functionality
   - **Changed**: Updates or improvements to existing features
   - **Fixed**: Bug fixes, error corrections
   - **Removed**: Features or functionality removed/deprecated

5. **Future releases**
   - When releasing a new version:
     1. Move all items from `[Unreleased]` to the new version heading.
     2. Add the release date.
     3. Create a new empty `[Unreleased]` section at the top.
